## About Me

I'm a cybersecurity undergrad student currently working as an **Identity and
Access Management (IAM) Analyst** in a long-term internship.

**I spend most of my time thinking about:** - College, work, personal projects and bankrupting myself by buying more gear

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What I'm Working With

**Languages** - JavaScript - Python - Go (currently learning)

**Areas of Interest** - Cloud computing and infraestructure - System
security - Linux internals - Networking fundamentals - self-hosting - Old hardware revival projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Homelab

I run a **Proxmox server at home** based on an old Dell Prebuilt (Yeah, it's outdated, laugh it up), where I experiment with:

-   Virtual machines and containers
-   Self-hosted services
-   Running local LLMs
-   Network segmentation
-   *Dealing with Windows and other proprietary garbage from Microsoft*
-   Breaking my Gentoo VMs on purpose 

Specs:

    CPU: Intel i7-3770
    RAM: 32 GB
    GPU: RTX 5050 8GB (Coming soon)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Philosophy

I strongly believe in:

-   Open standards
-   Open source software
-   Avoiding unnecessary abstraction
-   Reading documentation
-   Self teaching

If it runs on Unix, I probably like it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Miscellaneous Interests

-   Tinkering with older hardware
-   Bringing outdated machines back to life (if it wasn't obvious)
-   Learning about the history of computing
-   Anything related to Warhammer 40k and the AdMech
-   Microcontrollers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Current Focus

-   Deepening my understanding of security architecture
-   Becoming more comfortable with Go
-   Strengthening backend fundamentals
-   Building more serious infrastructure projects
-   Planning for a master's in either computer science or telecommunications engineering

------------------------------------------------------------------------
